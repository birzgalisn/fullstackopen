# [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

## About the course

### [Part 1](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1)

#### Introduction to React

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

### [Part 2](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2)

#### Communicating with server

Let's continue our introduction to React. First, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.

### [Part 3](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3)

#### Programming a server with NodeJS and Express

In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

### [Part 4](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4)

#### Testing Express servers, user administration

In this part, we will continue our work on the backend. Our first major theme will be writing unit and integration tests for the backend. After we have covered testing, we will take a look at implementing user authentication and authorization.

### [Part 5](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5)

#### Testing React apps

In this part we return to the frontend, first looking at different possibilities for testing the React code. We will also implement token based authentication which will enable users to log in to our application.

### [Part 6](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6)

#### State management with Redux

So far, we have placed the application's state and state logic directly inside React components. When applications grow larger, state management should be moved outside React components. In this part, we will introduce the Redux library, which is currently the most popular solution for managing the state of React applications.

### [Part 7](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7)

#### React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack

The seventh part of the course touches on several different themes. First, we'll get familiar with React router. React router helps us divide the application into different views that are shown based on the URL in the browser's address bar. After this, we'll look at a few more ways to add CSS styles to React applications. During the entire course, we've used create-react-app to generate the body of our applications. This time, we'll take a look under the hood: we'll learn how Webpack works and how we can use it to configure the application ourselves. We shall also have a look at hook functions and how to define a custom hook.

### [Part 8](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part8)

#### GraphQL

This part of the course is about GraphQL, Facebook's alternative to REST for communication between browser and server.

### [Part 9](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9)

#### TypeScript

This part is all about TypeScript: an open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript.

In this part, we will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem with linters predefined and an existing codebase writing TypeScript. After doing this part, you should be able to understand, develop and configure projects using TypeScript.
